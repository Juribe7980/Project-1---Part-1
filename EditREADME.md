### Objective:

 The goal of this is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in predicting sales.


### Data:
There are 8523 rows, and 12 columns.
The rows represent 8523 observations, and the columns represent 11 features and 1 target variable.

### Method:
To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:

- During the exploratory data analysis, a histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column. 
 - This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns.

## Model
The scores shows below are the results:

Decision Tree Model Test Scores

MAE: 1037.7232

MSE: 2190951.7954

RMSE: 1480.1864

R2: 0.2058826

Random Forest Model Test Scores

MAE: 728.286

MSE: 1095996.8902

RMSE: 1046.8987

R2: 0.6027525

## Recommendations:

In this case the model Decision Random Forest performed better on the R2.
